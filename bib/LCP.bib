  abstract = {Let K be a closed convex cone in a Hilbert space (H,〈·,·〉), and let K+ be its positive dual cone. The K-eigenvalues of a continuous linear mapping A:H→H are defined via the complementarity system: x∈K, Ax−λx∈K+, 〈x,Ax−λx〉=0. This paper explores two issues related to this concept: existence results, and upper bounds for the number of K-eigenvalues when the cone K is finitely generated. Special attention is devoted to the case of a Pareto cone in a finite dimensional space.},
